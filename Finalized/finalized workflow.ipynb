      "Pro life or pro choice?  |  I am pro choice. I feel bad for the baby. People have abortions for a reason. If it is forced, it will grow imperfectly. Born into the world in a state that is not optimal. With prochoice, her fate is more manageable.\n",
      "Pro life or pro choice?  |  Logically, both make sense. Conflicted between the two because pro life - you remove their chance of being born, pro choice - there are events that make the baby if born not 100 percent healthy. Also if the parents are not ready, financially etc. Life is a life - no matter what form it is\n",
      "Pro life or pro choice?  |  I'm pro life. Because in my belief, if a fetus is conceived, there is already life, there is already consciousness. And if you abort that it has a life collector. That thing that doesn't know anything gotta follow you anywhere. Maybe in the next time this couple will have a planned child. It would be even more difficult, what with birth defects etc. Contraception isn't good either - like pills. Sexual education is important, but sometimes lifestyle can't lie.\n",
      "Pro life or pro choice?  |  Prochoice. If she was a victim of rape, etc, she doesn’t want to keep the child, at least she has the option to choose. The unwanted child.\n",
      "Pro life or pro choice?  |  Prolife for religious reasons. Being religious is good. But most prolife people reject abortion altogether meaning that if there are defects etc. it is also not allowed. The birth is full of suffering. In the US it's a big deal because in Texas it's not allowed at all even because of incest.\n",
      "Do you think abortion should be legal?  |  Legal - not really legal - legal for special cases. Like for sexual assault, rape, etc. But at least 6 months - you can go over the pregnancy period. But really it should be all legal, because orphanages are still not 100% ideal. So it should be from prevention.\n",

      "Do you think abortion should be legal?  |  If it has a heartbeat, can it be called life? Nowadays, there is a fight for animal rights. Are animals more valuable than humans? If it's a life, it should be allowed to live. I'm prolife - no matter how hard life is, it has to be lived.\n",
      "Do you think abortion should be legal?  |  when something grows doesnt it count as life already including a fetus cause its growing?\n",
      "Do you think abortion should be legal?  |  KBBI - the process of baby child teenager adult to elderly. Adam and Eve were not from a fetus - meaning it was just a regenerating process (not yet human). In my personal opinion, a human being is a person who lives in this world and has a life - I disagree with the KBBI. This fetus is human but still prochoice, because he is human and we don't know what his fate is, it's a pity if he is continued and not aborted. It should be legal because it depends on the reason. If the reason is medical etc.\n",

      "We see from our side that maybe they are miserable. But how do we get the right to decide who lives and who doesn't?  |  Is it wrong to regret life? That is the right of the individual. The fetus is special because of the human species, even though it may have the same abilities as a chimpanzee. Life goes on, no matter how bad it is.\n",
      "We see from our side that maybe they are miserable. But how do we get the right to decide who lives and who doesn't?  |  Actually, we humans are well aware that life is really difficult. Only he will know what his difficulties and limitations are. It is precisely because we know life is difficult. Science is not based on morals, while we humans have moral standards. Can everything that is presented with standards and data refer to justice? Every thing has a consequence. Does that consequence make it better or worse? Not prolife and prochoice but what is from God is what is lived.\n",
      "We see from our side that maybe they are miserable. But how do we get the right to decide who lives and who doesn't?  |  The law didn't need to be revised. Choosing the middle path is the best path. Because the best choice is balancing these two choices, AKA taking the middle path. Humans can't live in temperatures that are too cold or hot. So balance is the best way.\n",
      "We see from our side that maybe they are miserable. But how do we get the right to decide who lives and who doesn't?  |  Rape victims, let's not confuse them, let's divide them into sections. In the context of marriage, the ideal is to build a family. If it's for health reasons, it's up to the person themselves. In the case of the 12-year-old who was raped, it's better to have an abortion: The government has the right to set regulations. From this point of view, she is a victim, it will be returned to the victim, if they don't want to, the government will accommodate them. Everything we do has consequences. I agree that there should be education. How do you build a healthy relationship as a moral person? As people who have beliefs? Because that will determine what happens in the future.\n"
